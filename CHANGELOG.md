## [Unreleased]

### Task 1: CCXT Source Setup
- `mix ccxt_extract.setup` mix task — installs npm bundle, checks TS source, verifies QuickBEAM and OXC
- Version tracking via `priv/ccxt_version.json` — records npm version, TS source version, git SHA, timestamp
- Warns on version mismatch between npm bundle and TS source
- Supports symlinked CCXT source (e.g., `ln -s ../ccxt priv/ccxt`)
- Discovery: `set_global(rt, "self", :global_this)` doesn't create `self === globalThis` — must use `QuickBEAM.eval` to set browser globals instead
- Added `:mix` to dialyzer PLT apps

### Project Setup
- Initial project creation with OXC, QuickBEAM, and npm_ex dependencies
- 5 example scripts demonstrating both extraction tools
- CLAUDE.md with mission, tools, and anti-bias rules
- ROADMAP.md with 4-phase discovery-first approach
